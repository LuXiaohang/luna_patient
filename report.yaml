how_might_we: How might we enable doctors to better manage patient relationships between visits?

product_narrative: We want to improve the quality of mental health care by strengthening communication between patient and doctor between visits. We  want to close the gap of understanding that exists between visits to ensure providers have an accurate view into the patients' weekly progress. Our product allows loved ones and other supporters to share their observations with a provider via confidential channels.
